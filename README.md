# Rocket Data Processing

Tested Concepts: read a file, parse data into dictionaries, handle common data errors, perform basic calculations, use a loop for targeted data analysis, and write structured, formatted data to a new file.

## Scenario

https://www.westpoint.edu/news/press-releases/class-of-2025-west-point-cadets-break-record-hypersonic-rocket-launch

You have graduated from CY300 and joined the SPEAR hypersonic rocket team. The latest hypersonic rocket has completed its test flight, and the raw telemetry data has been saved to a file named telemetry.txt. Each line in the file is supposed to represent a single data point containing a timestamp, altitude in kilometers, a temperature reading in Celsius, and the battery voltage. However, the transmission was partially corrupted during the high-speed flight. Some lines contain comments, and others have malformed or missing data. Your mission is to write a Python script that can reliably parse this file, structure it for easier analysis, and generate a clean `flight_summary.txt` file. You also need to pinpoint the exact moment the rocket reached its apogee, which is the highest point in its flight (maximum altitude). The rocket contains a solar panel that powers its systems, so the battery voltage may fluctuate significantly during the flight.

## Key Tasks

1. Create Data Lists: Before you start processing the file, create an empty list to hold valid telemetry data points. Each data point will be represented as a dictionary with the following keys: `timestamp`, `altitude_km`, `temp_c`, `voltage`, `pitch`, `yaw`, and `roll`.

2. Read the File: Open and read the `telemetry.txt` file line by line. The input file contains the following data format:

   ```
   timestamp, altitude_km, temperature_celsius, voltage, pitch, yaw, roll
   ```

	- timestamp: Unix timestamp (integer)
	- altitude_km: Altitude in kilometers (float)
	- temperature_celsius: Temperature in Celsius (float)
	- voltage: Battery voltage (float)
	- pitch: Pitch angle in degrees (float)
	- yaw: Yaw angle in degrees (float)
	- roll: Roll angle in degrees (float)

	The file may or may not have a header line, but if it does, it will start with `#` indicating a comment. Make no assumptions and simply ignore any lines that start with `#` or are empty.

3. Iterate and Parse: Iterate through each line of the file. Ignore the lines that contain comments starting with `#`. Also ignore any empty lines or lines. Use the built-in string methods to [strip](https://diveintopython.org/functions/string-methods/strip) and [split](https://diveintopython.org/functions/string-methods/split) each valid line into its components.

4. Validate the Data: A valid line must contain exactly seven parts. Timestamp should be integer. All other parts (altitude, temperature etc.) must be convertible to a float. Skip lines that do not conform to the expected format, e.g. `MALFORMED_DATA`.

5. Create the dictionary: If a line is valid, convert the altitude, temperature, voltage, pitch, yaw, roll to floats and add them to a dictionary representing a data point. If no valid data is found, set the maximum altitude, minimum voltage, and average temperature to 0.0.

6. Calculate Statistics: Write functions to calculate the following statistics from the list of valid data points:

	- Maximum altitude
	- Minimum voltage
	- Average temperature

7. Display the Results: Print the following results formatted as displayed in the sample output.

	- Count of how many lines were valid (ignore comments and corrupt lines)
	- Count of how many lines were corrupt (do not count empty lines or comments)
	- Maximum altitude should be a float rounded to one decimal place.
	- Minimum voltage should be a float rounded to two decimal places.
	- Average temperature should be a float rounded to one decimal place.

If no valid data is found, do not print the maximum altitude, minimum voltage, or average temperature.

## Sample Input

Filename: `telemetry_small.txt` and `telemetry_big.txt`

These files contain a large number of data points that your script will read. It contains a mix of valid data, comments, and errors. General format of the file is as follows:

### Attributes:
- timestamp (int)
- altitude_km (float)
- temperature_celsius (float)
- voltage (float)
- pitch (float)
- yaw (float)
- roll (float)

## Sample Output

Filename: `flight_summary.txt`

For the sample input above, the output should be:

```txt
Rocket Telemetry Analysis
-------------------------
Valid data points: 9
Corrupt data points: 3
Maximum Altitude: 149.6 km at 1750000784
Minimum Voltage: 3.81 V at 1750000818
Average Temperature: 300.4 C
```

The `telemetry_big.txt` file will result in the following output:

```txt

Corrupt data points: 6
Maximum Altitude: 149.6 km at 1750000784
